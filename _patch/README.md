# Installation
I don't really know how to make .patch files properly, so here's what you'll have to do for now:

* Install the original Bluetooth Notifications patch from Preware
* Turn all the notifications ON in Tweaks
* Close Tweaks
* Uninstall the original Bluetooth Notifications patch from Preware
* Install this patch using webOS Quick Install
* Don't re-launch Tweaks, or the new patch will get disabled
